    "In `sklearn`, you'll find you have a common programming choice: to do things very explicitly, e.g. pre-process data one step at a time, perhaps do a transformation like PCA, split data into traning and test sets, define a classifier or learner with desired parameters, train the classifier, use the classifier to predict on a test set and then analyze how good it did.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach and something `sklearn` offers is to combine some or all of the steps above into a pipeline so to speak.  For instance, one could define a pipeline which does all of these steps at one time and perhaps even pits mutlple learners against one another or does some parameter tuning with a grid search (examples will be shown towards the end).  This is what is meant here by layers of abstraction.\n",
