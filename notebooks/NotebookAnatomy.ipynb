To <b>reset<\/b> a notebook go to Cell -> All Output -> Clear and then Save it.\n\nYou can do something like this to render a publicly available notebook on github statically (this I do as a backup for presentations and course stuff):\n\n```\nhttp://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/<username>/<repo name>/blob/master/<notebook name>.ipynb\n```\nlike:<br>\nhttp://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/michhar/rpy2_sample_notebooks/blob/master/TestingRpy2.ipynb\n\n<br>\nAlso, you can upload, consume existing notebooks or start a new <b>interactive<\/b> one for free by going here (Microsoft's free notebook service):<br>\nhttps://notebooks.azure.com/\n<br>\n\n<br><br>\nAlso, notebook service available in Azure Machine Learning Studio (free and all you need is MS live ID/Account).  Go [here](https://studio.azureml.net/)\n\n> The nifty thing about Jupyter notebooks (and the .ipynb files which you can download and upload) is that you can share these.  They are just written in JSON language.  I put them up in places like GitHub and point people in that direction.  \n\n> Some people (like [this guy](http://www.r-bloggers.com/why-i-dont-like-jupyter-fka-ipython-notebook/) who misses the point I think) really dislike notebooks, but they are really good for what they are good at - sharing code ideas plus neat notes and stuff in dev, teaching interactively, even chaining languages together in a polyglot style.  And doing all of this on github works really well (as long as you remember to always clear your output before checking in - version control can get a bit crazy otherwise).\n\n### Some additional features\n* tab completion\n* function introspection\n* help", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "?sum()", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import json\n?json", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": false}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import json\n\n# place cursor in parentheses and hit Shift-Tab and see what happens\njson.loads()", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": false}}, {"source": "The MIT License (MIT)<br>\nCopyright (c) 2016", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}], "nbformat": 4, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.1", "name": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}}
